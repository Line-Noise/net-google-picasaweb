# Net-Google-Picasaweb

This is both a library and a set of simple scripts for reading information about
a Google PicasaWeb account.

If you download it from github, you will need to install it using Dist::Zilla.

    cpanm Dist::Zilla
    dzil authodeps | cpanm
    dzil install

Probably, however, you will want to install it from CPAN.

    cpanm Net::Google::PicasaWeb

or, if you don't have cpanm available:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::Google::PicasaWeb'
